**1. What to expect to learn:**  
+ installing a VM
+ create dynamic memory partitions  
etc ...

**2. Working with bash to create the monitoring script**  
`creating variables`  
`grep`  
`if conditions`  
`wall`  
`awk`

***I believe that every 42 project has a rich IT vocabulary behind it.***  
-> this one's goal is to deep dive into the VMs conception and how they work.
